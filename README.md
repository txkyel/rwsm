A local Rain World save manager for Windows

## DISCLAIMER

This is my first time working with batch scripts so there may be some issues with the copying behaviour.
Please be sure to make a back up of your saves before using.

## Usage

Change the variables at the top of the file if your Rain World saves are not located in `C:\Users\{YOUR_USERNAME}\AppData\LocalLow\Videocult\Rain World`
